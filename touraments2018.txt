The first round losers in the men's singles tournament will be entered into the singles plate tournament.  Losers of the first ladies' singles matches will go into the ladies plate.

As it is often difficult to arrange matches over the holiday season, please be organised in arranging your matches.

Please update the draw sheet on the board once you have played your match.

Any problems please contact tournaments@hamptontennis.org.uk
